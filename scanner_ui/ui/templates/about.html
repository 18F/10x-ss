  <h1>About 10x Site Scanner</h1>
  <p>
Site Scanner is developed through a project with 10x, a GSA program for technology-focused ideas from federal employees.
</p>
<p>
The vision of this project is to create a way for TTS to offer a low-cost, automated scanning solution so federal stakeholders can determine the best practices government websites are following and identify ways to improve website performance for the public and public servants. We envision an on-demand service that not only reduces the legwork that scanning has historically entailed, but also enriches the data for analyses available. Performance would be measured on a variety of key dimensions like mobile-friendliness, load times, responsiveness. Not only could stakeholders access this critical data, they'd also be able to copy the scan engine and build off of it for their own, customized uses.

  All 10x projects go through a series of <a ref="https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/">funded phases</a>. Here's a timeline of this project so far:
</p><p>
Original pitched idea (July 2018): The proposed idea focused on driving adoption of website best practices and standards, and pointed out there was no easy way to scan sites for this information. The current scanning infrastructure is not actively maintained, and some prototype scanners are sitting in a dev environment, un-deployed. There is no long-term solution for storing results (cloud.gov sandbox), and site scanning not architected to be either replicable (for interested parties to stand up their own copy of site scans) or extensible (for new, custom scans to be added to the suite). The idea was to build a cloud-based tool that automatically scanned sites which all federal employees could use to see what's behind any federal site.
</p><p>
Phase 1 (Date): Submitted idea is vetted by team and awarded Phase 2 funding.
</p><p>
Phase 2 (Date): Initial product strategy is formed. Federal groups interested in having a new tool are identified. Site Scanner MVP is born and tested with TTS stakeholders. Focus is on rearchitecting existing code to make future scanners easier to deploy, more stable, and/or more accurate, securing a place to house prototypes, developing a repeatable process to make future efforts easier.
</p><p>
Phase 3 (current): Product strategy is refined, outreach efforts expand. Goal is on building demand for this tool from nice-to-have to need-to-have. Focus development work on expanding domain list to subdomains, enabling API functionality, creating a customizable user interface for people wanting to build their own scanning engine or sort the data returned when using ours.
