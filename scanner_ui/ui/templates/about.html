  <h1>About 10x Site Scanner</h1>
  <p>
Site Scanner is developed through a project with 10x, a GSA program for technology-focused ideas from federal employees.
</p>
<p>
Weâ€™re creating a way for federal website and standards program managers to see, on demand, the standards and practices in use on federal sites and other information they need to make their jobs easier. Site Scanner automates and enriches the analysis available to make better federal websites.
</p>
<p>
  All 10x projects go through a series of <a ref="https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/">funded phases</a>. Here's a timeline of this project so far:
</p><p>
Original pitched idea (July 2018): Focused on driving adoption of website best practices and standards, and pointed out there was no easy way to scan sites for this information. The idea was to build a cloud-based tool that automatically scanned sites which all federal employees could use to see what's behind any federal site.
</p><p>
Phase 1 (Date): Submitted idea is vetted by team and awarded Phase 2 funding.
</p><p>
Phase 2 (Date): Initial product strategy is formed. Federal groups interested in having a new tool are identified. Site Scanner MVP is born and tested with TTS stakeholders.
</p><p>
Phase 3 (current): Product strategy is refined, outreach efforts expand. Goal is on building demand for this tool from nice-to-have to need-to-have.
The prototype will return data that the stakeholder(s) identify as useful, and will be built and documented to make it extensible and replicable.
