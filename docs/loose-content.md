### Prototypes

- [**200 scanner**](https://site-scanning.app.cloud.gov/search200/) - Checks domains for the presence or absence of a file at a specific location, specifically by analyzing the server response code at that location, such as x.gov/code.json, x.gov/data.jason, x.gov/data, x.gov/developer, x.gov/digitalstrategy, x.gov/open, x.gov/privacy, x.gov/robots.txt, x.gov/sitemap.xml
- [**U.S. Web Design System**](https://site-scanning.app.cloud.gov/searchUSWDS/) - Checks domains for the presence or absence of U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) components and USWDS version in use.



## Milestones

| Rank          | Priority      | Goal          | Measure       |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------  | ------------- |
| 1 | 1  | Data prototype returns data stakeholder(s) find useful and can take action on  | 1. Data - Discover data to incorporate on data.gov; show agency compliance with OPEN Data law; 2. APIs - Discover APIs to incorporate on API.data.gov; show agency compliance with White House Memos  |
| 2  | 2  | Prototype is built and documented to make it extensible and replicable  | Individual can either stand-up their own copy or add their own scan  |
| 3  | 2  | Path to scale prototype (if successful) is in place  | Recommendations for 10x phase III funding; recommendations for future scans; lessons learned; long-term data storage recommendations|
