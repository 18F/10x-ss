# Site Scanning System Description

The Site Scanning program looks for important features on federal websites. Sites that have these features are more successful. It is a free service. 

There are three (3) components to Site Scanner:
* The Scanning Engine runs scans on the domains and stores the results.
* Scanning Engine Plugins are single scans of different types. The scanning engine uses the plugins for its scans. Each plugin can also run on demand.
* Scan Result UI/API is a website to view and search scan results.
